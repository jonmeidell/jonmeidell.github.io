## Welcome to my full-stack web development portfolio!

**This is a simple base site using just html and css to showcase some of my completed work that I have done for full-stack web development.**

_This page is currently in process of periodic updates as I am improving my skills, so you will likely see improvements to the page as you visit it from time-to-time._

Cheers!

#### Improvements to be made:
  * _Minor tweaking to responsiveness on navbar between 576px and 767px_
